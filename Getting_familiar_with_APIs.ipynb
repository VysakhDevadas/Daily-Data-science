The storm formed near [[Cape Verde]] on August 4 and crossed the [[Atlantic]], turning northward around [[Bermuda]] before being absorbed by an [[extratropical cyclone]] while situated southeast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Irene proved to be a difficult storm to forecast due to oscillations in strength. After almost dissipating on August 10, Irene peaked as a [[Category 2 hurricane]] on August 16. Irene persisted for 14 days as a [[tropical system]], the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season. It was the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the record-breaking season.\\n\\nAlthough there were initial fears of a [[landfall]] in the [[United States]] due to uncertainty in predicting the storm\\'s track, Hurricane Irene never approached land and caused no recorded damage; however, [[Swell (ocean)|swells]] up to {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} and strong [[rip current]]s resulted in one fatality in [[Long Beach, New York]].\\n\\n==Meteorological history==\\n{{storm path|Irene 2005 track.png}}\\nHurricane Irene began as a Cape Verde storm. A vigorous [[tropical wave]] moved off the west coast of [[Africa]] on August 1, initially weakening due to cooler [[sea surface temperatures]]. It moved westward and passed near [[Cape Verde]], where [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] started to increase. The system subsequently developed into a tropical depression on the afternoon of August&nbsp;4, 690&nbsp;miles (1100&nbsp;km) southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.<ref name=\"IreneTCR\">{{cite web|author=|title=Tropical Cyclone Report: Hurricane Irene|url={{NHC TCR url|id=AL092005_Irene}}|url-status=live|access-date=April 24, 2006|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]; [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|format=PDF}}</ref> Early on August 5, the depression abruptly turned to the northwest into an area of higher [[wind shear]], causing some computer models to predict that the depression would dissipate, while others predicted steady strengthening.

The storm formed near [[Cape Verde]] on August 4 and crossed the [[Atlantic]], turning northward around [[Bermuda]] before being absorbed by an [[extratropical cyclone]] while situated southeast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Irene proved to be a difficult storm to forecast due to oscillations in strength. After almost dissipating on August 10, Irene peaked as a [[Category 2 hurricane]] on August 16. Irene persisted for 14 days as a [[tropical system]], the longest duration of any storm of the 2005 season. It was the ninth named storm and fourth hurricane of the record-breaking season.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough there were initial fears of a [[landfall]] in the [[United States]] due to uncertainty in predicting the storm\\'s track, Hurricane Irene never approached land and caused no recorded damage; however, [[Swell (ocean)|swells]] up to {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} and strong [[rip current]]s resulted in one fatality in [[Long Beach, New York]].\\\\n\\\\n==Meteorological history==\\\\n{{storm path|Irene 2005 track.png}}\\\\nHurricane Irene began as a Cape Verde storm. A vigorous [[tropical wave]] moved off the west coast of [[Africa]] on August 1, initially weakening due to cooler [[sea surface temperatures]]. It moved westward and passed near [[Cape Verde]], where [[Atmospheric convection|convection]] started to increase.

During the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball.
